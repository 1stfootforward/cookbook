Food is an integral part of our lives, and not in the least here at the Cancer Society, where preparing, sharing, enjoying, gifting, sustaining and loving food is part of healing and coping with cancer.</p><p>
									The recipes featured in The Food Connection have been chosen from an amazing selection offered by Cancer Society friends, volunteers, family, patients and supporters from throughout our Canterbury and West Coast region. The love and passion for the work and services delivered by the Cancer Society is reflected in the tempting selection of food treats showcased in this beautiful recipe book.</p><p>
									Our volunteers throughout the region are the face of the Cancer Society in their community, and many of the recipes contributed in this book are from our Cancer Society Volunteer Groups. We are also thrilled to be able to include some recipes from well-known New Zealand chefs who were delighted to support this project.</p><p>
									The Cancer Society’s work covers health promotion, the funding of cancer research and our supportive care programmes.  Having cancer can be hard, but finding help shouldn’t be. By purchasing this recipe book you are helping to ensure that our services are available to people when they need them. </p><p>
									Thank you for purchasing The Food Connection, we hope you enjoy it. </p><p>
									Happy Cooking</p><p>
